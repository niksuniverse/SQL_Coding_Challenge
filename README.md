✅ SQL database schema covering pets, shelters, donations, adoption events, participants, users, and adoptions  
✅ Primary and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity  
✅ Sample datasets to simulate real-world operations  
✅ Advanced SQL queries featuring joins, aggregations, subqueries, stored procedures, and filtering  
✅ Comprehensive reporting queries to extract valuable insights on pets, events, donations, and participants
